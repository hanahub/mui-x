# Virtualization

Virtualization is the feature that allows the grid to handle unlimited rows and columns seamlessly.
This feature is built in our rendering engine and is responsible to greatly improve rendering **performance**.

This is quite a restricted area and we exposed only the column buffer property in options that let you change the number of columns rendered outside the viewport.
By default, the `columnBuffer` is set to 2 columns, and we do **not** recommend to modify this setting.

```tsx
<XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} columnBuffer={2} />
```
