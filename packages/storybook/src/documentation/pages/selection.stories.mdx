# Selection

Selection provides the ability for users to highlight or select rows. It can be done with a simple Mouse click or using the keyboard shortcuts.
XGrid currently supports **Single** and **Multiple** rows selection.

By default, the grid allows multiple selection. However, this setting can be turned off using the property `enableMultipleSelection` of the `options` React prop.

```tsx
<XGrid
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  options={{ enableMultipleSelection: false }}
/>
```

## Multiple Selection

To activate multiple selection, put the focus on the XGrid component and maintain the `CTRL` key for Windows users or `Cmd` key for Mac OSX users.
You can then select another row by clicking on it or using Arrows keys or other keyboard shortcuts.

## Checkbox Selection

Another way to provide the ability to select rows in the grid is by adding a checkbox selection column.
To activate, this feature you need to toggle the `checkboxSelection` property of the `options` React prop as below.

```tsx
<XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} options={{ checkboxSelection: true }} />
```

Below is an example of a grid with `checkboxSelection` turned on.

### Disable selection on click

Sometimes, you might want to disable the selection on click for some cells. This could be the case if you wish to render a link or a button in a cell.
For this reason, we added a **column** option called `disableClickEventBubbling`. This option can be set on the column or `ColDef` interface as below.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'id', hide: true },
  { field: 'name', disableClickEventBubbling: true },
  { field: 'age', type: 'number' },
  ...
];
```

In the example below the column `name` is not clickable

## Events

To conveniently apply action on selected rows, we emit the following events based on user interaction.

- `onRowSelected` - Event emitted when one row is selected.
- `onSelectionChanged` - Event emitted when one or multiple rows are selected.

## API

Finally, we added the following methods in XGrid API. More about the API and how to use it [here]().

- `getSelectedRows` - Returns the selected rows
- `selectRows` - Select / deselect one or multiple rows
- `selectRow` - Select / deselect a single row.
