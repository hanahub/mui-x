# Layout

## Fix size container

By default, `XGrid` will look at its parent container `width` and `height` and render using the same `width` and `height` values to fill the whole space.
Hence if you would like to render a grid of a specific size, you can do so as below:

```tsx
<div style={{ width: 800, height: 600 }}>
  <XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} />
</div>
```

## Flex container

Using a `Flex` container is the recommended type of container to render the grid. They allow flexible layout, resize well, and works on all devices.

```tsx
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexGrow: 1 }}>
  <XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} />
</div>
```

## Follow content with `autoHeight`

The `autoHeight` property of the `options` react prop, allows to size the grid according to its content.
This means that the number of rows will drive the height of the grid and consequently, they all be rendered and visible to the user at the same time.

- **Note** This is not recommended for large dataset as row Virtualization will not be able to improve performance
  by limiting the number of elements rendered on the DOM.

```tsx
<XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} autoHeight />
```

## Resizing

XGrid follow its parent container size, hence if its parent container resize, XGrid will resize and re-render as well.
