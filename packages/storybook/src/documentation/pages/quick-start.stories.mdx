# Getting Started

## Install

Using your favorite package manager, install `@material-ui/x-grid` for the full featured enterprise grid, or `@material-ui/data-grid` for the free community version.

```sh
// with npm
npm install @material-ui/x-grid

// with yarn
yarn add @material-ui/x-grid
```

## Dependencies

The data grid is built on React, styled-components, and Material-UI.
Nonetheless, all these dependencies are placed as peers to avoid package duplication and its related issues.

To summarise, the component has the following peer dependencies.

To summarise, X-Grid has the following peer dependencies.

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "@material-ui/core": "^4.9.12",
  "react": "^16.13.1",
  "styled-components": "^5.1.0"
}
```

If you have not installed them yet, please do by running one of the following.

```sh
// with npm
npm install @material-ui/core react styled-components

// with yarn
yarn add @material-ui/core react styled-components
```

## Quick Start

If you have installed the component, you are now ready to build your first data grid.

First, you have to import the component as below.
To avoid name conflicts, the components are named **XGrid** and **DataGrid**.

```js
import { XGrid } from '@material-ui/x-grid';
```

### Define Rows

Rows are key-value pair objects, mapping column names as keys with their values.
You should also provide an id on each row to allow delta updates and better performance. //Should Id be optional?

Here is an example

```tsx
const rows: RowsProp = [
  { id: 1, col1:'Hello', col2: 'World'},
  { id: 2, col1:'XGrid', col2: 'Awesome'},
  { id: 3, col1:'Material-UI', col2: 'Amazing'},
  ...
];
```

### Define Columns

Comparable to Rows, Columns are objects defined with a set of attributes of the ColDef interface.
They are mapped to Rows through their `field` property.
_You can import `ColDef` to see all column properties._

A simple set of columns could be:

```tsx
const columns: ColDef[] = [
  { field: 'id', hide: true },
  { field: 'col1', headerName:  'Column 1', width: 150 },
  { field: 'col2', headerName:  'Column 2', width: 150 },
  ...
];
```

As mentioned above, we define our first column as `id`, with an `hide` attribute true to hide the column from the users. Therefore it can be used internally.

// Should we just always do that internally, in the component???

Id apart, the 2 columns defined, match the row block defined in the previous paragraph with the `field` attribute. It is the glue between Columns and Rows.

### Basic config options

The `options` properties let you apply different settings to the grid. The following can be set in the options property object of the component as below.

`<XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} options={{ hideFooter: true }} />`

`options` implement the `GridOptionsProp` interface. And some basic options include:

- **autoHeight** set the grid height to follow the dataset height
- **hideFooter** hide the container below the rows at the bottom of the component
- **pagination** turn pagination on or off.
- **checkboxSelection** will add an extra column with a checkbox that let you select rows by ticking the checkbox.
- **enableMultipleColumnsSorting** turn column multiple sorting on or off
- ...
