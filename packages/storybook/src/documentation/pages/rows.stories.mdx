# Rows

Rows or DataSet are defined by setting the `rows` property of the component. They are simple Array of RowData or `RowData[]`;
RowData are `Record` matching column field value.
Hence the following code defines a row with a simple field `name` and its corresponding column.

```tsx
rows = [{ name: 'XGrid' }];
columns = [{ field: 'name' }];
```

## Updating rows

Rows can be updated in 2 ways.

### Using component prop

The first and most obvious way is to bind a new or updated set of rows using the `rows` component property.
While this approach works well. It has some drawbacks

- You will need to pass the full set of updated rows.
- It can lead to bad performance due to extra rendering if you recreate the row object to merge your updates.

### Using API for Real-Time apps

The second way to update rows is to use the API and the `apiRef` object. This is the preferable approach for streaming and real-time api.
Updates are batched and re-rendered by the component at a "fixed" rate.
This means that if your streaming API updates every 10ms, XGrid and React will batch updates and rerender on request animation frame updates. That is between 45 and 100 ms depending on the client machine and data processing time.

**Note**

- `updateRowData` is the API function that allows applying the update on an existing row,
  however if the row id `RowId` is not found in the existing set of data, the row will be added to the dataset.

//Should I rename the function to `upsertRowData` ?

Below is a sample code showing how you can achieve this.

```tsx
function StreamingGrid() {
  const apiRef = useApiRef();
  const columns = [
    { field: 'id' },
    { field: 'username', width: 150 },
    { field: 'age', width: 80 },
  ];
  const rows = [
    { id: 1, username: randomUserName(), age: randomInt(10, 80) },
    { id: 2, username: randomUserName(), age: randomInt(10, 80) },
    { id: 3, username: randomUserName(), age: randomInt(10, 80) },
    { id: 4, username: randomUserName(), age: randomInt(10, 80) },
  ];
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = interval(200).subscribe((obs) =>
      api.current?.updateRowData([
        {
          id: randomInt(1, 4),
          username: randomUserName(),
          age: randomInt(10, 80),
        },
        {
          id: randomInt(1, 4),
          username: randomUserName(),
          age: randomInt(10, 80),
        },
      ]),
    );

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, [apiRef]);

  return (
    <XGrid
      rows={rows}
      columns={columns}
      apiRef={apiRef}
      autoHeight
    />
  );
}
```

<UpdateRows />

## Row Height

You can configure the row height in the options prop of the component.
The default value recommended by Material Design is 52px.
However you can change this value as below.

- `RowHeight` is a number in pixel unit.

```tsx
<XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} rowHeight={25} />
```
