# Sorting

XGrid provides row sorting natively on **Single** or **Multiple** columns.
By default, columns are all sortable and it can be revoked using the `sortable` property of the `ColDef` interface as below.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'name', sortable: false },
  ...
];
```

In the example below column `name` cannot be sorted.

## Single Column Sorting

Single column sorting can be triggered by a simple click on column headers. You can repeat this action to change the sorting direction and navigate between Ascending, Descending, and original order.
Likewise, you can pre-configure a sorted column using the `sortDirection` property of the `ColDef` interface as below.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'name', sortDirection: 'asc' },
  ...
];
```

Below is an example of a pre-configured sorted grid.

<SingleSortDemo />

### Sorting Order

By default, XGrid is configured to sort first in **Ascending** order, followed by **Descending** and back to the original order.
This behavior can be overwritten by setting the `sortingOrder` property of the `options` React prop as below.

```tsx
<XGrid
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  options={{ sortingOrder: ['desc', 'asc', null] }}
/>
```

The code above sets the `sortingOrder` property to first sort columns in **Descending** direction, followed by **Ascending** and back to the original order.

- **Note** `null` is the value mapped to the original order. You can drop this value or other direction to prevent users from sorting in one direction or another.

In the example below columns are only sortable in Descending then Ascending order.

<SortOrderDemo />

### Custom comparator

XGrid handles sorting and applies different comparators in columns according to their types. More about columns types [here]().
Hence, XGrid can handle sorting natively for the following types

- string
- number
- date
- dateTime

To extend or modify this behavior in a specific column, you can pass a custom comparator, and override the `sortComparator` property of the `ColDef` interface.

In the example below, the `username` column combines `name` and `age` but it is sorted by `age` using a custom comparator.

<CustomComparatorDemo />

## Multiple Columns Sorting

To activate multiple column sorting, put the focus on the XGrid component and maintain the `CTRL` key for Windows users or `Cmd` key for Mac OSX users.
You can then click on column headers to select your second, third... sorted column.
As for single-column sorting, you can pre-configure multiple sorted columns using the `sortDirection` property of the `ColDef` interface.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'name', sortDirection: 'asc' },
  { field: 'age', sortDirection: 'desc', type: 'number' },
  ...
];
```

In the example below, we pre-configured the grid to sort by `Name` `Ascending` and by `Age` `Descending`.

<MultipleSortColumnDemo />

But what if you want to sort first by Age then Name. See in the next section, how you can change the sorted column order.

### Setting `sortIndex` to change the sorted column order.

By default, multiple column sorting works with the column index of the array of columns.
As per our example above, the `name` column is positioned before the `age` column in the columns array.
Consequently, the `name` column is sorted first, and the `Age` column will be sorted second.
To override this behavior, you can set the property `sortIndex` on the `ColDef` interface as below.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'name', sortDirection: 'asc',  sortIndex: 2 },
  { field: 'age', sortDirection: 'desc', sortIndex: 1, type: 'number' },
  ...
];
```

<SortIndexDemo />

### Using the `sortModel` options

XGrid also offers to override the sortModel using its `sortModel` property of its `options` React prop.
**Note** The `sortModel` property is an array and its order will be used as the `sortIndex` property described above.

```tsx
<XGrid
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  options={{
    sortModel = [
      { field: 'age', sortDirection: 'desc' },
      { field: 'name', sortDirection: 'asc' },
    ],
  }}
/>
```

<SortModelOptionDemo />

## Server-side sorting

XGrid supports both client and server-side pagination. By default, sorting works on the client-side. To switch it to server-side,
set the property `sortingMode` to `server` as string or you can use our `FeatureModeConstant`.

Then, you're going to need to handle the `onColumnsSortingChange` event, to intercept the event, sort the rows on the server side and update the component with the new sorted rows.

```tsx
const [rows, setRows] = React.useState<RowsProp>([]);
const onColumnsSortingChange = (params) => {
  sortServerRows(params).then((newRows) => {
    setRows(newRows);
  });
};

<XGrid
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  options={{
    sortingMode: 'server',
    sortModel: sortBy,
    onColumnsSortingChange,
  }}
/>;
```

<ServerSortingDemo />

## Events

- `onColumnsSortingChange` - Event triggered when the sort model change and before a column is sorted.
- `onColumnsSorted` - Event triggered after columns are sorted.

## API

Finally, we added the following methods in XGrid API. More about the API and how to use it here.

- `getSortModel` - Returns the currently applied `SortModel`
- `setSortModel` - Set a `SortModel` to sort the grid in one or multiple columns
- `onColumnsSorted` - Set a handler for the `onColumnsSorted` event
- `onColumnsSortingChange` - Set a handler for the `onColumnsSortingChange` event
