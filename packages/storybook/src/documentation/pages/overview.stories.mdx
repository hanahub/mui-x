# Overview

The Data Grid component is designed to display and analyze tabular data. It leverages the power of React and TypeScript, to provide the best UX, while manipulating an unlimited set of data.
As one of our X advanced component series, it comes with an intuitive API for real-time updates, accessibility, as well as theming and custom templates, all with blazing fast performance.
