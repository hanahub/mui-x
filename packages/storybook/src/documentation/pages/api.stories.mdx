## How to use ApiRef?

The `ApiRef` allows you to manipulate the grid outside the React component scope.
To enable ApiRef, you need to use the `useApiRef` hook and pass the ref to the component prop as below.

```tsx
const apiRef = useApiRef();
...
return <XGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} apiRef={apiRef} />

```

## Use cases

If you would like to manipulate the grid outside the component rendering the XGrid, for example if you are building some custom filters.
You could pass the apiRef using the context or as a prop.

This can also be very handy in a streaming api to update rows with changes from the server as we have exposed in our Rows section [here]().
