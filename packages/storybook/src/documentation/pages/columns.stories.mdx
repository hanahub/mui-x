# Columns

After importing XGrid or DataGrid, you're now ready to use the component in your JSX, and configure your grid columns.
To do this, you need to define the columns property of the component as below.
If you use TypeScript, you can enforce the typing and define the prop with 'Columns' or 'ColDef[]' type.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  {
    field: 'columnId',
    headerName: 'My Column Id',
    description: 'Something about this grid is amazing!',
    width: 100,
    sortable: true,
    type: 'number',
  },
];
```

In the code above we define a column with some of the basic attributes.

- `field` is a mandatory field and is used to associate the column header with the corresponding value in the rows that follow. It's similar to an id, but has to be a string.
- `headerName` is the title visible in the grid column header. If not set, `field` will be used in the header.
- `description` is the description of the column that will be displayed in a tooltip if the column header is too small to render the full column title.
- `width` is the width the column will be when the component has mounted.
- `sortable` is an optional boolean that allows making the column sortable.
- `type` is the type of the column, _more on this below_.

The full list of column option is defined in the `ColDef` interface and can be found here (TODO: add link to ColDef generated doc)

## Column types

To facilitate column configuration, some column types are predefined.
By default, columns are assumed to hold strings and thus the default column string type will be applied.
As a result, column sorting will use the string comparator, and the column content will be aligned to the left side of the cell.

The following types are built in:

- string
- number
- date
- dateTime

To apply a column type, you just need to define the `type` property in your column definition.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'name' }, // `type: 'string'` by default
  { field: 'age', type: 'number' },
  { field: 'dateCreated', type: 'date' },
  { field: 'lastLogin', type: 'dateTime' },
];
```

In the code above, we are defining 4 columns, and just by applying a type, each column will be sortable with the correct comparator for its type.
We also added locale formatting for date, dateTime, and number Columns.

### Extending col type? Adding new col type?

## Hiding

Hiding a column is pretty straightforward, you just need to toggle the `hide` attribute of the column definition.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [{ field: 'hiddenCol', hide: true }];
```

## Sizing

To define the width of a column, you can use the `width` attribute available in ColDef. You can also resize the column, using the column resize separator icon, available on the column header. If you would like to block the resizing of a column, you can do by setting the resizable prop to false.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'largeCol', width: 200 },
  { field: 'unresizableCol', width: 200, resizable: false },
];
```

## Getting values

Sometimes a column might not have a corresponding value and you just want to render a combination of different fields.
To do that, you can set the `valueGetter` attribute of `ColDef` as in the example below.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'firstName' },
  { field: 'lastName' },
  {
    field: 'fullName',
    valueGetter: ({ data }) => `${data.firstName} ${data.lastName}`,
  },
];
```

- `valueGetter` is a function of type `(params: ValueGetterParams) => CellValue;`, therefore you can destructure `params` to get all the row data, as in the example above.
  TODO API ref the valueGetter interface here!

## Formatting

Formatting data before rendering is a common task. It is used in the built in `date` or `dateTime` column types to apply local formatting to dates.

```tsx
const columns: Columns = [
  { field: 'date', headerName: 'Year'  valueFormatter: ({value})=> value.getFullYear() }
]
```

- `valueFormatter` is a function of type `(params: ValueFormatterParams) => CellValue;`, therefore you can destructure `params` to get the column value as in the example above.
  TODO: API ref the valueFormatter interface here!

## Options

There are more options in `ColDef` which you can find the full definition in the API page (TODO: add link here)

- `disableClickEventBubbling`: allows you to disable the default click behaviour of the grid. If you render a clickable component in a column, such as a link or a button, you can use this option to disable the row selection on click.
