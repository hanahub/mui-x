# Quick Start

The official Material-UI Data Grid Component built in Typescript.

Have a look at our demo app ** [here](https://muix-preview.netlify.app/#/grid)**.

## Install

Using your favourite package manager, install `@material-ui/x-grid` for the full featured enterprise grid, or `@material-ui/data-grid` for the free community version

```shell script
//with npm
npm install @material-ui/x-grid

//with yarn
yarn add @material-ui/x-grid
```

## Dependencies
To avoid package duplication, and its related issues, we let you control our dependencies.
Hence, X-Grid has the following peerDependencies.
```
"peerDependencies": {
    "@material-ui/core": "^4.11.0",
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "styled-components": "^5.1.0"
},
```
If you have not installed them yet, please do by running one of the following.
```shell script
//with npm
npm install @material-ui/core react styled-components

//with yarn
yarn add @material-ui/core react styled-components
```

## Overview

After installing the package, you are now ready to use the grid.
First you have to import the component as below.
To avoid component clashing, we named our components **XGrid** and **DataGrid**.
If you don't use Material-UI core grid layout <a href='https://material-ui.com/components/grid/'>here</a>, and don't have any other components named grid, you can also import **Grid**.

`import { XGrid } from '@material-ui/x-grid';`

Then you need to create some columns which are simple objects containing at least a field property.
You can import `ColDef` to see all column properties.
A simple set of columns could be:

```tsx
const columns: ColDef[] = [
     { field: "id", width: 80},
     { field: "brand", headerName:  'Brand Name', width: 150}
     ...
  ];
```

Rows are key value pair objects.

```tsx
const rows: RowsProp = [
    { id: 1, brand:'Nike'},
    { id: 2, brand:'Addidas'},
    { id: 3, brand:'Puma'},
    ...
  ]
```

The `options` properties let you apply different settings to the grid.

A complete example is below.
