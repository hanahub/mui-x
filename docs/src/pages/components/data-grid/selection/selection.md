Row selection can be performed with a simple mouse click, or using the [keyboard shortcuts](/components/data-grid/accessibility/#selection). The grid supports single and multiple row selection.

### Single row selection

Single row selection is enable by default with the `DataGrid` component.
For the `XGrid`, you need to disable multiple row selection with `disableMultipleSelection={true}`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/selection/SingleRowSelectionGrid.js", "bg": "inline"}}

### Multiple row selection [<span class="pro"></span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-x/)

To activate multiple selection, put focus the `XGrid` component and hold the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key while selecting rows.

## Checkbox selection

To activate checkbox selection set `checkboxSelection={true}`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/selection/CheckboxSelectionGrid.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## Disable selection on click

You might have interactive content in the cells and need to disable the selection of the row on click. Use the `disableClickEventBubbling` option in this case.

## apiRef [<span class="pro"></span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-x/)

The grid exposes a set of methods that enables all of these features using the imperative apiRef.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use this API when you have no alternative. Always start from the declarative API that the grid exposes.

- `onSelectionChange`: Callback fired when the selection state of one or multiple rows changes.

> üëç Upvote [issue #208](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x/issues/208) if you want to see it land faster.

With this feature, you will be able to select ranges of cells across the Grid.
