# Data Grid - Accessibility

<p class="description">The Data Grid has complete accessibility support. For instance, every cell is accessible using the keyboard.</p>

## Guidelines

The most commonly encountered conformance guidelines for accessibility are:

- [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) - Globally accepted standard
- [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) - US Department of Justice
- [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) - US federal agencies

WCAG 2.0 has 3 levels of conformance; A, AA and AAA (in order of conformance).
As meeting WCAG 2.0 level AA guidelines also meets the ADA and Section 508 standards, it's likely the standard that most organizations will want to target.

The [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#grid) provides valuable insight on how to make the grid highly accessible.

## Keyboard navigation

The grid responds to keyboard interactions from the user as well as emitting events when key presses happen on the grid cells.
