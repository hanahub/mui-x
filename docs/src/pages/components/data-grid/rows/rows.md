# Data Grid - Rows

<p class="description">This section goes in details on the aspects of the rows you need to know.</p>

## Feeding data

Grid rows can be defined with the `rows` prop.
`rows` expects an array of objects.
Rows should have this type: `RowData[]`.
The columns' "field" property should match a key of the row object (`RowData`).

## Updating rows

Rows can be updated in two ways:

### The `rows` prop

The simplest way is to provide the new rows using the `rows` prop.
It replaces the previous values. This approach has some drawbacks:

- You need to provide all the rows.
- You might create a performance bottleneck when preparing the rows array to provide to the grid.

The second way to update rows is to use the apiRef.
This is an imperative API that is designed to solve the previous two limitations of the declarative `rows` prop. `apiRef.current.updateRows()`, updates the rows to the grid. It **merges** the new rows with the previous ones.

The following demo updates the rows every 200ms.

## Row height

By default, the rows have a height of 52 pixels.
This matches the normal height in the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/components/data-tables).

To change the row height for the whole grid, set the `rowHeight` prop:

Each cell takes up the width of one row.
Row spanning allows to change this default behavior.
It allows cells to span multiple rows.
This is very close to the "row spanning" in an HTML `<table>`.

Row reorder is used to rearrange rows by dragging the row with the mouse.
