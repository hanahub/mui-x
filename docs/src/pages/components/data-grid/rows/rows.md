# Data Grid - Rows

<p class="description">A fast and extendable data table and data grid for React. It's a feature-rich compoent available in MIT or Enterprise versions.</p>

## Row sorting

### Basic sorting

Single column sorting can be triggered with one click on column header.
You can repeat this action to change the sorting direction.

You can pre-configure a sorted column using the `sortModel` prop of the `ColDef` interface as below:

```ts
const sortModel = [
  {
    field: 'commodity',
    sort: 'asc' as SortDirection,
  },
];
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/rows/BasicSortingGrid.js"}}

### Custom comparator

The Grid handles sorting and applies different comparators in columns according to their types.
The component handles sorting natively for the following types:

- string
- number
- date

To extend or modify this behavior in a specific column, you can pass a custom comparator, and override the `sortComparator` prop of the `ColDef` interface.

In the example below, the `username` column combines `name` and `age` but it is sorted by `age` using a custom comparator:

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/rows/ComparatorSortingGrid.js"}}

### Sorting order

By default, the sorting order loops between these tree different modes:

```jsx
const sortingOrder = ['asc', 'desc', null];
```

In practice, when you click a column that is not sorted, it will sort ascending (`asc`).
The next click will make it sort descending (`desc`). Another click will remove the sort (`null`), using the orginal order the data was provided in.
This behavior can be overwritten by setting the `sortingOrder` prop.

In the example below columns are only sortable in descending then ascending order.

### Disable sorting

By default, columns are all sortable and it can be revoked using the sortable prop of the `ColDef` interface as below.

```tsx
const columns: ColDef = [{ field: 'name', sortable: false }];
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/rows/DisableSortingGrid.js"}}

### Server-side sorting

By default, sorting works on the client-side.
To switch it to server-side, set `sortingMode="server"`.
Then, you need to handle the `onSortModelChange` callback, sort the rows on the server-side and update the `rows` prop with the new sorted rows.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/rows/ServerSortingGrid.js"}}

### apiRef

The Grid exposes a set of methods that will let you achieve all the above features using the imperative apiRef.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use this API when you have no alternatives. Always start from the declarative API the Grid exposes.

- `getSortModel`
- `setSortModel`
- `onSortModelChange`

### Multi-column sorting ‚ú®

You can sort by multiple columns at the same time using `XGrid`.
Hold the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key down while clicking the column header.

```ts
const sortModel = [
  {
    field: 'commodity',
    sort: 'asc' as SortDirection,
  },
  {
    field: 'desk',
    sort: 'desc' as SortDirection,
  },
];
```

Each cell takes up the width of one row.
Row spanning allows to change this default behavior.
It allows cells to span multiple rows.
This is very close to the "row spanning" in an HTML `<table>`.

## Row reorder

Row reorder is used to rearrange rows by dragging the row with the mouse.
