# Data Grid

<p class="description">The best grid. A fast and extendable data table and data grid for React. It's a feature-rich component available in MIT or Commercial versions.</p>

Data tables display information in a grid-like format of rows and columns. They organize information in a way thatâ€™s easy to scan, so that users can look for patterns and insights.

The component leverages the power of React and TypeScript, to provide the best UX, while manipulating an unlimited set of data. It comes with an intuitive API for real-time updates, accessibility, as well as theming and custom templates, all with blazing fast performance.
