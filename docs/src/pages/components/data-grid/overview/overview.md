# Data Grid

<p class="description">A fast and extendable data table and data grid for React. It's a feature-rich component available in MIT or Commercial versions.</p>

The component leverages the power of React and TypeScript, to provide the best UX, while manipulating an unlimited set of data. It comes with an intuitive API for real-time updates, accessibility, as well as theming and custom templates, all with blazing fast performance.

## Overview

Data tables display information in a grid-like format of rows and columns. They organize information in a way that‚Äôs easy to scan, so that users can look for patterns and insights. The data grid comes in 2 versions:

- `DataGrid` **MIT licensed** as part of the community edition. It's an extension of `@material-ui/core`.
- `XGrid` **Commercially licensed** as part of the X product line offering.

The features only available in the commercial version are suffixed with a <span style="font-size: 26px" role="img" title="Enterprise">‚ö°Ô∏è</span> icon.
You can check the [feature comparison](/components/data-grid/getting-started/#feature-comparison) for more details.
See [Pricing](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-x/) for details on purchasing licenses.

### MIT version

The first version is meant to simplify the [Table demo](https://material-ui.com/components/tables/#sorting-amp-selecting) with a clean abstraction.
This abstraction also set constraints that allow the component to implement new features.

```js
import { DataGrid } from '@material-ui/data-grid';
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/overview/DataGridDemo.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Commercial version [<span role="img" title="Enterprise">‚ö°Ô∏è</span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-x/)

The following grid displays 31 columns and 100,000 rows - over 3 million cells in total.

```js
import { XGrid } from '@material-ui/x-grid';
```
