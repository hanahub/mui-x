# Data Grid - Localization

<p class="description">The Date Grid will support users from different locale, with formating, RTL, and localized strings.</p>

The default locale of Material-UI is English (United States). If you want to use other locales, follow the instructions below.

## Translation keys

You can use the `localeText` prop to pass in your own text and translations.
You can find all the translation keys supported in [the source](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x/blob/HEAD/packages/grid/_modules_/grid/constants/localeTextConstants.ts) in the GitHub repository.
In the following example, the labels of the density selector are customized.

The data grid will support dozens of locales with a simple import that includes all the translated messages.
You will be able to follow [this guide](/guides/localization/#locale-text) to use them.
