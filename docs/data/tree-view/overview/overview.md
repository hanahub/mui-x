# MUIÂ X Tree View

<p class="description">A Tree View widget presents a hierarchical list.</p>

Tree views can be used to represent a file system navigator displaying folders and files, an item representing a folder can be expanded to reveal the contents of the folder, which may be files, folders, or both.

## Available components

There are two versions of the Tree View available.

### SimpleTreeView

It is designed for simple use-cases where the items are hardcoded.

Most new advanced features won't be available on this component.
If you are waiting for features like editing or virtualization, you should use `RichTreeView` instead.
