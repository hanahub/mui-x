# Data Grid

<p class="description">A fast and extendable react data table and react data grid. It's a feature-rich component available in MIT or Commercial versions.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

The component leverages the power of React and TypeScript, to provide the best UX while manipulating an unlimited set of data. It comes with an intuitive API for real-time updates, accessibility, as well as theming and custom templates, all with blazing fast performance.

## Overview

> Visit the [installation guide](/x/react-data-grid/getting-started/#installation) to learn how to install the correct package version and dependencies.

Data tables display information in a grid-like format of rows and columns.
They organize information in a way that‚Äôs easy to scan so that users can look for patterns and insights.

The data grid comes in two different versions:

### MIT version

The first version is meant to simplify the [Table demo](/material-ui/react-table/#sorting-amp-selecting) with a clean abstraction.
This abstraction also set constraints that allow the component to implement new features.

```js
import { DataGrid } from '@mui/x-data-grid';
```

{{"demo": "DataGridDemo.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false, "bg": "inline"}}

### Commercial version [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](https://mui.com/store/items/material-ui-pro/)

The following grid displays 31 columns and 100,000 rows - over 3 million cells in total.

```js
import { DataGridPro } from '@mui/x-data-grid-pro';
```

{{"demo": "DataGridProDemo.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false, "disableAd": true, "bg": "inline"}}

### MIT vs. commercial
