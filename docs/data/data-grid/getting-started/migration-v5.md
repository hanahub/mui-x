# Migration from v5 to v6

<p class="description">This guide describes the changes needed to migrate from v5 to v6.</p>

## Start using the alpha release

In `package.json`, change the version of the data grid package to `next`.

```diff
-"@mui/x-data-grid": "latest",
+"@mui/x-data-grid": "next",
```

Using `next` ensures that it will always use the latest v6 alpha release, but you can also use a fixed version, like `6.0.0-alpha.0`.

## Breaking changes

Since v6 is a major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
These changes were done for consistency, improve stability and make room for new features.
Below are described the steps you need to make to migrate from v5 to v6.

The list is currently empty, but as we move forward with development during the alpha and beta phases, we'll feed this page with all changes in the API.
