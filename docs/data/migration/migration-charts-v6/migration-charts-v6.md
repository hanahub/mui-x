# Migration from v6 to v7

<p class="description">This guide describes the changes needed to migrate Charts from v6 to v7.</p>

## Introduction

This is a reference guide for upgrading `@mui/x-charts` from v6 to v7.
The change between v6 and v7 is mostly here to match the version with other MUIÂ X packages.
Not big breaking changes are expected.

## Start using the new release

In `package.json`, change the version of the charts package to `next`.

```diff
-"@mui/x-charts": "6.x.x",
+"@mui/x-charts": "next",
```

## Update `@mui/material` package

To have the option of using the latest API from `@mui/material`, the package peer dependency version has been updated to `^5.15.0`.
It is a change in minor version only, so it should not cause any breaking changes.
Please update your `@mui/material` package to this or a newer version.

## Breaking changes

Since `v7` is a major release, it contains changes that affect the public API.
These changes were done for consistency, improved stability and to make room for new features.

### Renaming

Some types got renamed for coherence:

| v6                                | v7                       |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `ChartsTooltipSlotComponentProps` | `ChartsTooltipSlotProps` |
| `ChartsTooltipSlotsComponent`     | `ChartsTooltipSlots`     |
