Zooming is possible on the **Pro**[<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan') versions of the charts: `<LineChartPro />`, `<BarChartPro />`, `<ScatterChartPro />`.

## Basic usage

To enable zooming and panning, set the `zoom` prop to `true` on the wanted axis.

Enabling zoom will enable all the interactions, which are made to be as intuitive as possible.

The following actions are supported:

- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out by scrolling the mouse wheel.
- **Drag**: Pan the chart by dragging the mouse.
- **Pinch**: Zoom in/out by pinching the chart.

## Zooming options

You can customize the zooming behavior by setting the `zoomOptions` prop.

The following options are available:

- **minStart**: The starting percentage of the axis range. Between 0 and 100.
- **maxEnd**: The ending percentage of the zoom range.
- **step**: The step of the zooming function. Defines the granularity of the zoom.
- **minSpan**: Restricts the minimum span size.
- **maxSpan**: Restricts the maximum span size.
- **panning**: Enables or disables panning.

## Controlled zoom

You can control the zoom state by setting the `zoom` and `onZoomChange` props.
This way, you can control the zoom state from outside the chart.

The `onZoomChange` prop is a function that receives the new zoom state.

While the `zoom` prop is an array of objects that define the zoom state for each axis with zoom enabled.

- **axisId**: The id of the axis to control.
- **start**: The starting percentage of the axis range.
- **end**: The ending percentage of the zoom range.
