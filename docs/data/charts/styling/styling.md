# Charts - Styling

<p class="description">This page groups topics about charts customistion.</p>

## Colors

Series accept a property `color` which is the based color used to render its components.

```jsx
<ScatterChart
  series={[
    {
      // ...
      color: '#fdb462',
    },
  ]}
/>
```

To avoid having to color series one by one, charts have a default color cycle.
If a series does not have a color, a default color will be applied according to the index of the series.

You can override this color cycle by using prop `colors` to charts components (or `<ChartContainer />` if you are using composition).
This prop takes an array of colors.
Such array of colors can be generated by using [d3-scale-chromatic](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes).

Here is the example of the d3 Categorical color palette.
