# Charts

<p class="description">A fast and extendable library of react chart components for data visualization.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Overview

The `@mui/x-charts` is an MIT library to render charts.
It relies on D3.js for data manipulation and SVG for rendering.

Like other MUI X components, charts are built to be production-ready components with nice integration into your application for common use cases.
They also provide a high level of customization.

To achieve this goal, the `@mui/x-charts` relies on three levels of customization:

- _single components_ with nice defaults
- extensive _configuration props_
- subcomponents for _composition_

To modify the styling of charts you can rely on all the MUI styling tools, such as the theme override, or the `sx` props.

## Documentation

:::info
This documentation does not follow the usual MUI structure.
:::

Each component has two docs pages:

- The first one describes behaviors that are specific to this component.
- The second one provides a set of basic examples.

For features shared across multiple components, likes axes and legends, visit their corresponding documents:

- [Axis](/x/react-charts/axis/)
- [Custom components](/x/react-charts/components/)
- [Legend](/x/react-charts/legend/)
- [Stacking](/x/react-charts/stacking/)
- [Styling](/x/react-charts/styling/)
- [Tooltips and Highlights](/x/react-charts/tooltip/)
