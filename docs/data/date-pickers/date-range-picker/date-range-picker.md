# Date Range Picker [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

<p class="description">The Date Range Picker let the user select a range of dates.</p>

## Basic usage

{{"demo": "BasicDateRangePicker.js"}}

## Component composition

The component is built using the `MultiInputDateRangeField` for the keyboard editing and the `DateRangeCalendar` for the view editing.
All the documented props of those two components can also be passed to the Date Range Picker component.

Check-out their documentation page for more information:

- [Date Range Field](/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-field/)
- [Date Range Calendar](/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-calendar/)

## Uncontrolled vs. Controlled

The component can be uncontrolled or controlled

{{"demo": "DateRangePickerValue.js"}}

## Available components

The component is available in four variants:

- The `DesktopDateRangePicker` component which works best for mouse devices and large screens.
  It renders the views inside a popover and allows editing values directly inside the field.

- The `MobileDateRangePicker` component which works best for touch devices and small screens.
  It renders the view inside a modal and does not allow editing values directly inside the field.

- The `DateRangePicker` component which renders `DesktopDateRangePicker` or `MobileDateRangePicker` depending on the device it runs on.

- The `StaticDateRangePicker` component which renders without the popover/modal and field.

{{"demo": "ResponsiveDateRangePickers.js"}}

By default, the `DateRangePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query [`@media (pointer: fine)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

:::warning
Responsive components can suffer some inconsistencies between testing environments if media query is not supported.
Please refer to [this section](/x/react-date-pickers/base-concepts/#testing-caveats) for solutions.

## Form props

The component can be disabled or read-only.

### Render 1 to 3 months

### Custom input component

You can customize the rendering of the input with the `TextField` component slot.
Make sure to spread `inputProps` correctly to the custom input component.
