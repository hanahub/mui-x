# Date Range Picker [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

<p class="description">The date range picker let the user select a range of dates.</p>

:::warning
This page describes how the legacy date range pickers work.
If you are already using the v6 alpha or beta, we recommend you to try the [new date range pickers](/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-picker/).

At the end of the v6 beta phase, the legacy date range pickers will be removed and replaced the new date range pickers
(which will be renamed to match the current name of the legacy pickers).
:::

## Basic usage

Note that you can pass almost any prop from [DatePicker](/x/react-date-pickers/legacy-date-picker/).

{{"demo": "BasicDateRangePicker.js"}}

## Static mode

It's possible to render any picker inline. This will enable building custom popover/modal containers.

{{"demo": "StaticDateRangePickerDemo.js", "bg": true}}

## Responsiveness

The date range picker component is designed to be optimized for the device it runs on.

- The `MobileDateRangePicker` component works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The `DesktopDateRangePicker` component works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `DateRangePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query [`@media (pointer: fine)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

There are certain caveats when testing pickers, please refer to [this section](/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#testing-caveats) for more information.

## Form props

The date range picker component can be disabled or read-only.

{{"demo": "FormPropsDateRangePickers.js"}}

## Validation

You can find the documentation in the [Validation page](/x/react-date-pickers/validation/)

## Different number of months

Note that the `calendars` prop only works in desktop mode.

{{"demo": "CalendarsDateRangePicker.js"}}

## Custom input component

You can customize the rendered input with the `renderInput` prop. For `DateRangePicker` it takes **2** parameters â€“ for start and end input respectively.
If you need to render custom inputs make sure to spread `ref` and `inputProps` correctly to the input components.

{{"demo": "CustomDateRangeInputs.js"}}

## Customized day rendering

The displayed days are customizable with the `Day` component slot.
You can take advantage of the internal [DateRangePickerDay](/x/api/date-pickers/date-range-picker-day/) component.
