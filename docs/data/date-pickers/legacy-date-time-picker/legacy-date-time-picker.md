# Date Time Picker

<p class="description">This component combines the date & time pickers.</p>

:::warning
This page describes how the legacy date time pickers work.
If you are already using the v6 alpha or beta, we recommend you to try the [new date time pickers](/x/react-date-pickers/date-time-picker/).

At the end of the v6 beta phase, the legacy date time pickers will be removed and replaced the new date time pickers
(which will be renamed to match the current name of the legacy pickers).
:::

It allows the user to select both date and time with the same control.

Note that this component is the [DatePicker](/x/react-date-pickers/legacy-date-picker/) and [TimePicker](/x/react-date-pickers/legacy-time-picker/)
component combined, so any of these components' props can be passed to the DateTimePicker.

## Basic usage

Allows choosing date then time. There are 4 steps available (year, date, hour, and minute), so tabs are required to visually distinguish date/time steps.

{{"demo": "BasicDateTimePicker.js"}}

## Responsiveness

The `DateTimePicker` component is designed and optimized for the device it runs on.

- The `MobileDateTimePicker` component works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The `DesktopDateTimePicker` component works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `DateTimePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query [`@media (pointer: fine)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

There are certain caveats when testing pickers, please refer to [this section](/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#testing-caveats) for more information.

## Form props

The date time picker component can be disabled or read-only.

## Validation

You can find the documentation in the [Validation page](/x/react-date-pickers/validation/)

## Static mode

It's possible to render any date & time picker inline. This will enable building custom popover/modal containers.

## Customization

Here are some examples of heavily customized date & time pickers:
